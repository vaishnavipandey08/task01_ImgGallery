# ðŸŒ¿ The Nature Gallery - Task 1 by Code Alpha ðŸŒ¿

## Project Overview

The **Nature Gallery** is an image gallery web application that displays a beautiful collection of nature images. This project was developed as **Task 1** for the Code Alpha Internship Program. It provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and navigating through images using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The gallery is fully responsive and adjusts well to different screen sizes.
- **Interactive Image Viewer**: Users can click on thumbnails to view a larger version of the image in the main display area.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Users can navigate through the images seamlessly using next/previous buttons.
- **Simple and Elegant UI**: The design focuses on simplicity with a clean and modern look, using soft colors that enhance the visual appeal.

## Technologies Used
